content:
  - Q: \(f(x) = x^2\)
    A: \(f^\prime(x) = 2x\)
    text: The power rule states that the derivative of \(x^n\) is \(nx^{n-1}\).
  - Q: \(f(x) = 2x^3 + 3x^2\) 
    A: \(f^\prime(x) = 6x^2 + 6x\)
    text: The power rule states that the derivative of \(x^n\) is \(nx^{n-1}\), and the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives.
  - Q: \(f(x) = \sin(x)\) 
    A: \(f^\prime(x) = \cos(x)\)
    text: |
      The derivative of \(\sin(x)\) is \(\cos(x)\) according to standard differentiation rules.  Or, you can consult the
      series expansion of \(\sin(x)\) and differentiate term by term.
  - Q: \(f(x) = \ln(x)\) 
    A: \(f^\prime(x) = \frac{1}{x}\)
    text: The derivative of \(\ln(x)\) is \(\frac{1}{x}\) according to standard differentiation rules.
  - Q: \(f(x) = e^{2x}\) 
    A: \(f^\prime(x) = 2e^{2x}\)
    text: The derivative of \(e^{kx}\) is \(ke^{kx}\) according to standard differentiation rules.
  - Q: \(f(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1\) 
    A: \(f^\prime(x) = 4x^3 - 12x^2 + 12x - 4\)
    text: The power rule states that the derivative of \(x^n\) is \(nx^{n-1}\), and the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives.
  - Q: \(f(x) = \cos(x)\) 
    A: \(f^\prime(x) = -\sin(x)\)
    text: The derivative of \(\cos(x)\) is \(-\sin(x)\) according to standard differentiation rules.
  - Q: \(f(x) = \tan(x)\) 
    A: \(f^\prime(x) = \sec^2(x)\)
    text: The derivative of \(\tan(x)\) is \(\sec^2(x)\) according to standard differentiation rules.
