combine
-------

This very simple utility combines multiple PDF files into a single PDF.

It is used as follows:

``pygacity combine <output_file.pdf> <input_file1.pdf> <input_file2.pdf> ...``

where ``<output_file.pdf>`` is the name of the combined output PDF file, and ``<input_file1.pdf>``, ``<input_file2.pdf>``, etc. are the names of the input PDF files to be combined in the specified order.
